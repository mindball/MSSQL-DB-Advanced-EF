# XML Processing
```
EXtensible Markup Language

Universal notation (data format / language) for
describing structured data using text with tags

Designed to store and transport data

The data is stored together with the meta-data about it
```
### Root element – required to only have one
### Elements – define the structure
### Attributes – element metadata
### Values – actual data, that can also be nested elements

## Advantages of XML:
### XML is human-readable (unlike binary formats)
### Stores any kind of structured data
### Data comes with self-describing meta-data
### Full Unicode support
### Custom XML-based languages can be designed for certain apps
### Parsers available for virtually all languages and platforms

## Disadvantages of XML:
### XML data is bigger (takes more space) than binary or JSON
```
More memory consumption, more network traffic, more
hard-disk space, more resources, etc.
```
### Decreased performance
```
CPU consumption: need of parsing / constructing the XML tags
```
### XML is not suitable for all kinds of data
```
E.g. binary data: graphics, images, videos, etc.
